## Chatbot Development Timeline ⏱
The chatbot code is developed by back-end developers Nicole Lee and Masha Karach, focused on helping users on our website to be able to talk to an anonymous bot that can answer any questions they may have about RPI or the Panhellenic Community. Its original development was coded through Python and openAI's API and was able to use a machine learning model. However, both the back-end developers found it hard to combine openAI's API with the trained model so we looked towards other options. Luckily Masha was able to come up with the idea of creating a chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, Masha was able to give advice and feedback and Nicole primarily coded any adjustments. Both developers decided to use Google's [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) due to it's easy implementation within JavaScript and provided us with ideas for a file upload feature. Nicole also thought of the idea of an Emoji keyboard using GitHub's open source [EmojiMart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) so users are able to express themselves if needed. Nicole also decided to name her PaigePal to appeal to users and not just talking to a robot.
