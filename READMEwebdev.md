# WEB DEV README - Emanuelle Simchowitz

## Key Contributions

While my contributions may not be immediately visible through the number of code commits to the github, as of the last few weeks my role has been to ensure PanHelper has a strong, cohesive foundation. Below are the main areas where I have made significant contributions:

### 1. **Website Design**
   - I fronted design phase of the project, ensuring that the visual elements, layout, and overall aesthetic aligned with our project's goals and remained accessible, readable, easily translatable.
        - This included the creation of our brand identity, mockups, and the sitemap, which helped set the direction for our web interface.
   - Tools used: Adobe Suite, Figma, Pinterest, my sketchbook.

### 2. **Translating Design to HTML/CSS**
   - After finalizing the designs, I was responsible for starting to translate the mockups into HTML and CSS, ensuring that the visual vision was accurately reflected in code. This is an ongoing task that I will be continuing as we go forward in a more consistent manner.
   - Contributions Include:
     - Structuring the pages with clean, semantic HTML.
     - Styling the elements using CSS to reflect the branding and visual design choices.
     - Creating reusable styles and components for consistency across the site.

### 3. **Information Architecture and Sitemap Creation**
   - I designed the information architecture and created a comprehensive sitemap to organize how content and pages are structured within the website so that its open source nature is kept and the code is easy to understand.
   - This work helped guide the rest of the team in understanding how the different parts of the website connect and how users can navigate through it.
   - Ensured a logical, user-friendly flow of information, from landing pages to deeper content within PanHelper.

### 4. **Organizing the Website's Structure**
   - I played a key role in organizing the directory structure for the project, ensuring that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets (such as images and fonts) are placed in logical, easy-to-navigate locations within the repo and website.
   - This helped streamline collaboration by making it clear where different parts of the site are located and how they should be edited.
   - Additionally, I made sure that all of the members of my group were able to understand where everything is supposed to go. This included:
        - Making one organization and two repos, one for the web development, another for the games development so we can easily track progress and keep our proverbial workspace clean.

### 5. **Visual Resources Creation**
   - I created all the visual resources for the site, including icons, logos, and decorative elements.
   - My goal was to ensure that every visual element is consistent and supports the branding and identity of the website.
   - Tools used: Adobe Illustrator, Figma.

## Future Contributions

Now that the design mockups and structural guidelines have been finalized, I will shift my focus more towards coding the pages and bringing my designs to fruition as we continue to build out the website.

## Conclusion

While my work has largely focused on design and organization so far, I look forward to contributing more directly to the development process as we continue the project. I believe that the foundational work I've done in structuring, designing, and organizing the project has set us up for success, and I'm excited to bring that same level of commitment to my further coding phase moving forward in this RCOS project.
