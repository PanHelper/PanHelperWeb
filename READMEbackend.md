# Dynamic Calendar, To-Do List, and Chatbot Integration

## Project Overview  
This project combines a **dynamic calendar**, a **to-do list**, and a **machine learning-powered chatbot** to make scheduling and task management easier.  

---

## Features  
- **Dynamic Calendar**: Add, edit, and delete events, with drag-and-drop for rescheduling.  
- **Dynamic To-Do List**: Create, prioritize, and sync tasks with the calendar.  
- **Chatbot**: A smart assistant trained to help with scheduling and answering task-related questions.

## How It Works  

### Dynamic Calendar & To-Do List  
1. **User Interaction**:  
   - Add events and tasks in a clean, interactive interface.  
   - Calendar and to-do list sync automatically.  
2. **Technology**:  
   - Built with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** and libraries like **FullCalendar.js** for the calendar.  
   - Used **Node.js** and **MongoDB** for data storage and server-side logic.  

### Chatbot  
1. **Training the Bot**:  
   - Collected example questions and responses.  
   - Used **Python** with **TensorFlow** to train the chatbot to understand and answer user queries.  
2. **Integration**:  
   - Linked the chatbot to the app so it can suggest event times or answer task-related questions.

## Challenges  
1. **Real-Time Updates**: Solved by using tools like **WebSockets** for instant syncing.  
2. **Chatbot Accuracy**: Improved by fine-tuning the model with task-related examples.

## Future Ideas  
- Add notifications for tasks and events.  
- Include voice commands for easier interaction.  
- Make the chatbot even smarter with more training data.
